# Angular Stopwatch

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.2.12.

Using RxJS version 6.6.0 and Typescript version 4.3.5.

## About application

This app demonstrates stopwatch application operation using RxJS.

## Functionality

- Start button - starts the timer.
- Pause button - works on double click (time between clicks <300 ms). The timer stops timing. If you press start after a pause, the countdown will resume.
- Stop button - stops and resets the timer value.
- Refresh button - resets the timer and starts counting again.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
